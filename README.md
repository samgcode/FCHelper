# FCHelper

FCHelper is a mod that helps for full clearing maps! Don't want to submit your full clear golden to goldberries only to find out 2 months later there was a moonberry no one knew about? well no more! FC Helper shows cassettes, moon berries, and crystal hearts on the pause screen, as well as showing them in debug with keybinds to center on cassettes, moon berries, and hearts.

As always, the code is public on [github](https://github.com/samgcode/FCHelper)
